          Your username isn't a place to attack, impersonate, or be vulgar. Please, keep your username PG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Keep it a friendly PG</strong>
          Please refrain from posting, commenting, or sharing porn or other forms of adult content. Please
          don't curse, use offensive language, attack others, or attack yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Don't try to break Adocasts</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="block" style="margin-bottom: .5rem;">Don't spam</strong>
          We ask that if you self-promote you also contribute to Adocasts in other ways too. Other means of spamming are frowned upon as well.
